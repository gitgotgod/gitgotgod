- 👋 Hi, I’m @gitgotgod

I have a lifelong fascination with technology and computers, which began during my childhood when I would frequently tinker with computers and engage in basic troubleshooting at my uncle’s computer store. This early exposure ignited my passion for all things tech-related.

Following my school years, I pursued a career in teaching, which allowed me to leverage my natural problem-solving skills in a different context. Though I was professionally dedicated to education, I consistently sought creative methods to instruct my students effectively. My teaching experience honed my problem-solving abilities, teaching me to adapt to different learning styles and find innovative ways to engage and educate.

However, as time passed, my enthusiasm for computers and technology never waned. This unshakable passion led me to a pivotal decision to enroll in a tech bootcamp. Since then, I have embarked on an exciting journey of continuous learning, keeping pace with the ever-evolving tech landscape. My pursuit of knowledge and hands-on experience in the field has reinforced my commitment to my first love: computers and technology.
Through my accelerated coding bootcamp, I spent time mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL in only four months. I've continued my education since then exploring React JS and AWS.
